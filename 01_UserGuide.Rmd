* `Postbreeding` - Population was censused after a birth pulse
* `Intermediate` - Population was censused between successive birth pulses (e.g. bears give birth while hidden in winter dens, which makes pre- or post-breeding censuses impractical
* `Birth-flow` - Population for which reproduction occurs continually over an interval (e.g. humans)
 
### `MatrixSplit` (Matrix form)

**Definition:** This indicates whether the MPM **A** matrix has been divided into its constituent **U**, **F** and **C** submatrices. See Figure 3 below for further details

Possible values:

* `Divisible` - The matrix population model A has been been divided into the process-based submatrices U, F and C
* `Indivisible` - The matrix population model **A** has not been divided into the process-based sub-matrices **U**, **F** and **C** because insufficient information is available to classify the various demographic processes for each sub-matrix. In indivisible matrices, only **A** has values given - the other matrices are filled with `NA` values
 
### `MatrixFec` (Matrix form)

**Definition:** This records whether fecundity was measured at all for this matrix model

The rationale for this is that a fecundity (in the **F** matrix) may be recorded as 0 either because it was not measured, or because reproduction was measured and estimated to be zero. As a general rule, if any values for fecundity (e.g. in the **F** matrix) are non-zero, then `MatrixFec` should be recorded as ‘`Yes`’. If all values are zero, then you we check the paper carefully to check whther this is because no fecundity was detected, or whether no attempt was made to measure fecundity

Possible values:

* `Yes` - Reproduction was included in the MPM, and thus values 0 should appear in the submatrix **F** if sexual reproduction occurred in these stages/ages. Note that it is possible that reproduction was measured and modelled but none occurred. In that case, values of 0 are possible in the **F** matrix
* `No` - Reproduction was not modelled by the matrix population model, either because it was not the goal of the study or due to logistical impossibility. In some **F** submatrices the elements where sexual reproduction would have appeared contain `NA` values, and in others they contain 0 values
* `NA` - it is not known whether fecundity was measured for the matrix
 
### `Observations` (Matrix form)

**Definition:** This variable provides information that is not provided elsewhere but may nonetheless be important (e.g. plant canopy, burning intervals, etc.)

Possible values:

* any text - Any text string giving useful additional information
 
### `MatrixDimension` (Matrix form)

**Definition:** Dimension of the matrix population model **A**

Possible values:

* *integer* - e.g. `5`
 
### `SurvivalIssue` (This is not a field, it needs to be calculated from the survival matrix)

**Definition:** This is a calculated field used for checking matrix data. It is the maximum stage-specific survival value in the survival **U** submatrix. To calculate `SurvivalIssue`, we sum each column in the **U** matrix individually. The maximum value among those sums **is** the `SurvivalIssue`.

**Note:** This value is only calculated with a number if `MatrixSplit` = “`Divided`”, that is, if the matrix is able to be split into submatrices. If `MatrixSplit` = “`Indivisible`”, the matrix is not divisible, so there is no survival **U** submatrix. In the case of indivisible matrices, the `SurvivalIssue` field will be empty (`NA`) and “Not Calculated” (`NC`) in the SQL database

Possible values:

* *numeric* - e.g. `0.9`, `1.2`, `1.45`
* `NA` - Matrix population model is not divisible into submatrices

* `prop` - Propagule (seed). This applies to every stage defined by the author as seed bank or seed. Users are encouraged to carefully examine matrices with these stages and to implement the appropriate calculations to avoid a spurious additional year being added when no seedbank exists in the study species, as explained by Caswell (2001, p. 60)
* `active` - This includes stages that can neither be placed in the prop nor dorm (see below) stages
* `dorm` - A stage that is vegetatively dormant after having germinated and becoming established
 
### `MatrixClassNumber` (The number of classes in a matrix. This has to be calculated from `MatrixClassOrganized`)

## Appendix - The calculation of mean matrix population models

* In COMPADRE we present the individual matrix population models for each season, year, study population and treatment that can be calculated from a paper, as well as those personally communicated by the publication authors to the COMPADRE digitization team. When pertinent, mean matrix population models that are element-by-element averages (arithmetic mean) across all Unmanipulated matrix population models (defined above) and across each treatment group are also given. Mean matrix population models that combine estimates from different treatments, or that combine estimates from treatments with unmanipulated conditions, are not calculated because of their lack of biological interpretation (Figure 2).
* Seasonal matrix population models, where more than one matrix population model exists for a single year, are marked as “Seasonal”. For these, we calculate average matrix population models for each season but not for each year (Figure 3). Deriving an annual model from seasonal data is straightforward and the calculations are described by Caswell (2001, p. 349).

![](figures/image1.2.png)

**Figure 2.** *Schematic showing how mean population matrix models are derived from all available population matrix models in a study. **A.** For  annual population matrix models (those that follow population dynamics from one year to the next, or sometimes more – some tree species are studied with a 5-year interval), element-by-element means are first calculated across the population matrix models describing the population dynamics for time periods within each population. Then the grand element-by-element mean is calculated across the matrix population models for the different populations. This procedure is repeated for models describing dynamics under each imposed treatment (pink matrices below) and for those describing the dynamics of unmanipulated populations (gray). Note that mean population matrix models are only calculated from population matrix models that share the same treatment (or absence of treatment). **B.** For seasonal or periodic population matrix models (e.g. for annual species), the mean seasonal population matrix model is calculated within populations and then across populations, both for matrices describing treated populations and for those describing populations with no imposed treatment (i.e. unmanipulated).*

In the Leslie matrix model example (**A**) , the division of sub-matrices is more straightforward than in the Lefkovitch matrix model example  (**B**). In the latter imaginary example, individuals can transition into the same stage as they can contribute with sexual and/or clonal offspring (e.g. small stage). In these cases, splitting A into sub-matrices U, F and C is only feasible when sufficient information is provided by the authors (see variable `MatrixSplit` in above).*
